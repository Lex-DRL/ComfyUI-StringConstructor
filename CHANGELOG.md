## `TODO`

The pack has already started to sip into dictionary-editing domain. Only the validator and the actual formatting node needs to stay. The rest need to go to their own repo.

- ~~Multi-item nodes.~~
- ~~Bulk `Search & Replace` within **keys** in dictionary.~~

# v1.0.3

- [fix] Nodes made compatible with built-in preview nodes.
- Some internal refactoring/cleanup.

# v1.0.2

- New node: `Validate Format-Dict`

# v1.0.1

- ‚ùó Recursive formatting.
- Tiny tweaks to tooltips/descriptions.

# v1.0.0

The minimally-complete version.

New node:
- `Add ANY to Format-Dict (Advanced)`

The Format-Dict data type name changed from `STR_DICT` to just `DICT` - for potential compatibility with other nodes.

# v0.0.1

MVP nodes:
- `Add String to Format-Dict`
- `Format-Dict from Text`
- `Format-Dict Preview`
- `String Formatter`
